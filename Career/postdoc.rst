Seeking postdoctoral positions starting in Fall 2025
----------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

I'm a microbiome data scientist looking for a postdoctoral research position starting early 2026 to further develop my expertise and contribute to cutting-edge research in the field of microbiome science. I currently reside in Portland, Oregon but also open to relocating nationally or internationally, or remote-work. 

Research Interests
------------------

I am interested in contributing to research in the following areas:

- **Environment and gut microbiome interaction with host health**: How exogenous factors (e.g. diet, pollutants, pathogens, climate change, etc.) impact gut microbiome stability and resilience to influence host health and homeostasis.
- **Temporal stability of microbiome systems**: Developing new frameworks for evaluating temporal patterns of microbiome stability. 
- **Multi-omic microbiome analysis**: Integrating multivariate multi-omic data to clarify patterns and mechanisms of microbiome stability.
- **Transdisciplinary Microbiome Research**: Collaborating across disciplines to elucidate the microbiome's central role interfacing between host health, public health and social equity. 

Research Highlights
-------------------

Microbiome and Host Health
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**What:**

- My first project was a multi-factorial microbiome zebrafish study investigating the effects of different commonly used laboratory diets on pathogen exposure sensitivity. 

**Why:**

- Inconsistency in diet may contribute to inconsistency in microbiome zebrafish study results and challenge our ability to integrate and replicate results across studies.
- Additionally, given that the gut microbiome interfaces with diet and intestinal pathogens, diet may be a key factor in determining host susceptibility to infection.

**How:**

- To address this, I fed cohorts of zebrafish one of three commonly used laboratory diets and then exposed them to a pathogen. 
- I then measured the microbiome's response to the diets and pathogen in adult zebrafish at 4 and 7 months of age.

**Findings:**

- Diet influenced the assembly and successional development of the microbiome, as well as fish's susceptibility to infection.

**Outcome:**

- An important implication of this work is that environmental context can confound microbiome-host health associations.
- This work resulted in a peer-reviewed manuscript `(Sieler et al. 2023) <https://rdcu.be/djX1r>`_.

Gut Microbiome Stability to Multiple Stressors
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**What:**

- My `second <https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.28.644597>`_ and third `<https://doi.org/10.3389/frmbi.2025.1605168>`_ PhD dissertation chapters investigated how historical contingency shapes host-microbiome system responses to sequential environmental stressors in zebrafish.

**Why:**

- Anthropogenic stressors are reshaping ecosystems through intersecting forces that may exceed the adaptive capacities of vertebrate holobionts.
- While gut microbiomes are key mediators of host health, little is known about how mounting environmental pressures affect host-microbiome system responses to future perturbations.
- Historical contingency – where past events shape future community assembly – has been studied in microbial ecosystems, but its role in defining host-microbiome responses to perturbations remains unclear.

**How:**

- I used zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) to investigate whether host-microbiome system responses to parasite exposure and recovery from prior stressors are contingent upon historical stressors.
- I sequentially exposed 720 adult zebrafish to antibiotics, elevated temperature, and/or the intestinal parasitic helminth *Pseudocapillaria tomentosa* across eight unique exposure regimes.
- I then quantified host health outcomes, gut microbiome diversity and composition, and host intestinal gene expression using integrative multi-omic analysis.

**Findings:**

- Historical stressors fundamentally alter host-microbiome system responses to future perturbations, with cumulative stress exposure producing dose-dependent increases in host mortality (9.4% to 27.8% after two stressors).
- Prior stress exposure can uncouple pathogen load from survival outcomes, as demonstrated by antibiotic treatment reducing parasite burden while paradoxically increasing mortality.
- Host-microbiome coupling itself is historically contingent, where prior stressors enhance, redirect, or disrupt the relationship between host transcriptional programs and microbial community dynamics, creating persistent effects that extend into recovery phases.

**Outcome:**

- These findings demonstrate that historical contingency operates across multiple levels within holobionts, fundamentally influencing both resistance to future perturbations and resilience during recovery phases.
- This work has profound implications for understanding organismal responses to the sequential stressors characteristic of the Anthropocene.

Small Molecule Metabolomics Analysis
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**What:**

- During my Biostatistics and Data Science PhD internship at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, I evaluated 12 common batch effect correction algorithms (BECAs) used for small molecule metabolomics analysis. 

**Why:** 

- Metabolomics comprises the study of various small molecules, including proteins, lipids, amino acids, etc., but often studies treat all of these metabolites similarly during analysis.

**How:**

- To address this, we conducted a study using a dataset that contained ground truth or no ground truth to compare the performance of 12 common batch effect correction algorithms (BECAs) used for small molecule metabolomics analysis.

**Findings:**

- I found that particular BECAs were better at resolving unwanted versus wanted variation when ground truth is known or unknown in lipidomic analysis, and these BECAs performance differed to optimal BECAs for other types of metabolites. 

**Outcome:**

- An important implication of this work is that researchers can use these results to guide optimal BECA selection to improve the accuracy of their analysis.
- This work is currently in-preparation for publication.
