Seeking postdoctoral positions starting in Summer 2025
-----------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

As I approach the end of my PhD in Tom Sharpton's lab, I'm soon to be #OpenToWork. I'm a computational microbial ecologist looking for a postdoctoral research position to further develop my expertise and contribute to groundbreaking research in microbiome science. I currently reside in Portland, Oregon but also open to relocating nationally or internationally, or remote-work. 

Research Interests
------------------

My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within microbiology and gut microbiome studies, including:

- **Microbiome and Host Health**: Understanding the intricate relationships between the gut microbiome and host health, with a particular focus on disease prevention and treatment.
- **Environmental Impacts on Microbiomes**: Investigating how environmental stressors such as climate change, diet, pathogens, and pollutants affect microbiome stability and resilience.
- **Microbial Ecology**: Exploring the dynamics of microbial communities and their adaption in response to environmental changes.
- **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**: Utilizing computational tools and statistical models to analyze microbiome data and develop new methods for microbiome research.
- **Transdisciplinary Microbiome Research**: Collaborating across disciplines to elucidate the microbiome's central role interfacing between host health, public health and social equity. 

Research Highlights
-------------------

**Gut Microbiome Stability and Host Health**

- Conducted extensive longitudinal research on how multiple and combined environmental stressors impact gut microbiome stability to influence host health using the zebrafish model organism.

**System-Agnostic Dynamical Microbiome Measures**
- Developed novel system agnostic dynamical microbiome measures (SADMMs) to quantitatively measure temporal microbiome responses to environmental stressors across different microbiome systems and environmental conditions.

**Multi-omic Microbiome Analysis**

- Integrated multivariate multi-omic data to provide a comprehensive view of the gut microbiome and its functional potential.



Publications
------------

I have authored several publications in peer-reviewed journals, showcasing my research findings and contributions to the field of microbiome science. A complete list of my publications can be found `here <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Publications/publications.html>`_.

Future Directions
-----------------

In a postdoctoral research position, I aim to:

- Expand my research on the gut microbiome stability and its role in supporting host health and homeostasis.
- Explore and integrate new multi-omic methodologies and technologies for microbiome analysis.
- Collaborate with researchers and institutions across a diverse array of fields to drive innovation and discovery in microbiome science.
