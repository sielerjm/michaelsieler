Seeking postdoctoral positions starting in Fall 2025
----------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

I'm a microbiome data scientist looking for a postdoctoral research position starting Fall 2025 to further develop my expertise and contribute to cutting-edge research in the microbiome field. I currently reside in Portland, Oregon but also open to relocating nationally or internationally, or remote-work. 

Research Interests
------------------

I am interested in contributing to research in the following areas:

- **Environment and gut microbiome interaction with host health**: How environmental stressors (e.g. diet, pollutants, pathogens, climate change, etc.) impact gut microbiome stability and resilience to influence host health and homeostasis.
- **Temporal dynamics of host-microbiome systems**: Elucidating temporal patterns in microbiome response to disturbances. 
- **Multi-omic microbiome analysis**: Integrating multivariate multi-omic data to provide a comprehensive view of the gut microbiome and its functional potential.
- **Transdisciplinary Microbiome Research**: Collaborating across disciplines to elucidate the microbiome's central role interfacing between host health, public health and social equity. 

Research Highlights
-------------------

**Microbiome and Host Health**
- My first project was a multi-factorial microbiome zebrafish study investigating the effects of different commonly used laboratory diets on pathogen exposure sensitivity. I found that fish microbiomes varied by diet and fish fed certain diets were more sensitive to pathogen exposure. This work resulted in a peer-reviewed manuscript `(Sieler et al. 2023) <https://rdcu.be/djX1r>_`.

**Small Molecule Metabolomics Analysis**
- During my Biostatistics and Data Science PhD internship at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, I evaluated 12 common batch effect correction algorithms (BECAs) used for small molecule metabolomics analysis. I found that particular BECAs were better at resolving unwanted versus wanted variation when ground truth is known or unknown in lipidomic analysis, and these BECAs performance differed to optimal BECAs for other types of metabolites. This work is currently in-preparation for publication.

**Gut Microbiome Stability and Host Health**
- My second and third PhD dissertation chapters build on my prior work investigating zebrafish microbiome ecology. Notably, I’m developing novel methods for evaluating system-agnostic temporally dynamic  microbiome stability. To do so, I led the design and execution of a major longitudinal microbiome study with 720 zebrafish across 8 multifactorial treatment regimes (e.g., antibiotics, temperature, parasites). I collected intestinal gut and fecal samples from all fish for genomic and transcriptomic analysis. From these data, I’ve developed metrics that complement microbiome metrics for measuring diversity and composition to assess temporal stability across different host-microbiome systems. These metrics would allow researchers to integrate results across studies to identify generalizable patterns of microbiome stability to predict health/disease.

Future Directions
-----------------

In a postdoctoral research position, I aim to:

- Expand my research on the gut microbiome stability and its role in supporting host health and homeostasis.
- Explore and integrate new multi-omic methodologies and technologies for microbiome analysis.
- Collaborate with researchers and institutions across a diverse array of fields to drive innovation and discovery in microbiome science.
