Tutoring
========

Hi there, my name is Michael Sieler. I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate in Microbiology. My research investigating the environmental factors that contribute to gut microbiome stability and human health require that I have a strong background in microbiome ecology, statistics, data science, and bioinformatics programming. I also have experience communicating research to scientific and lay audiences. I'm passionate about teaching and helping others learn, and I'm excited to offer my tutoring services to you!


**I offer tutoring services for the following subjects:**
* Programming
* Statistics and data science
* Bioinformatics
* Life sciences
* Science communication
* Language learning
