About Me
========

Microbial bioinformatics is a rapidly evolving field. No longer at the whims of culturing microbes, microbial bioinformaticians can run their experiments as fast as their computational power allows them. While this has led to the development of new tools and insights into our microbial world and human health, it can be a difficult field to break into if you aren't familiar with the ins and outs of computer programming. The major goal of this site is to improve accessibility of bioinformatics to people of any skill level. Whether you're an early career scientist just getting started learning about bioinformatics or a seasoned professional, hopefully we'll have something that everyone can learn on your journey of becoming a more proficient bioinformatician.

Short Story
-----------

Hi there! My name is Michael Sieler. I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the Sharpton Lab at Oregon State University. My research combines molecular, computational and statistical approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the gut microbiome that influence our health. In other words, I'm interested in figuring out how the microbes that coexist with us, specifically in our guts, influence our health.
