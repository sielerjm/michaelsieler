Who are you?
------------

I'm Michael Sieler. I'm currently doing my Ph.D. in Microbiology with a minor in Biological Data Science in the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ at Oregon State University (OSU).


What is your background?
------------------------

Briefly, I got my bachelor's degree in Bioresou01001101 01101001 01100011 01101000 01100001 01100101 01101100 00100000 01010011 01101001 01100101 01101100 01100101 01110010 00101110 00100000 01010010 01100101 01110011 01100101 01100001 01110010 01100011 01101000 00101100 00100000 01010000 01110010 01101111 01101010 01100101 01100011 01110100 01110011 00101100 00100000 01000010 01101100 01101111 01100111 00101110 00100000 01010111 01100101 01101100 01100011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00101110
https://www.convertbinary.comrce Research with a focus in Bioinformatics and Genomics at Oregon State University. My sophomore year in 2017, I joined the Mahmud lab in the College of Pharmacy at OSU, searching for novel antibiotics produced by *Streptomyces* bacteria. This is where I cut my teeth learning molecular biological methods for culturing, genetically engineering, extracting and amplifying bacterial DNA, and analysis of the novel antibiotic compounds our bacteria produced.

The more I learned about microbes and ecology, I found my interests shifted to the gut microbiome. I was also interested in the intersection of molecular and computational approaches to better understand the microbiome and their influence on human health. This led me to join the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ in 2018, where I conducted my undergraduate thesis project, investigating the effects of the environmental toxicant Benzo(a)Pyrene on the neurobehavioral and gut microbiome development of juvenile zebrafish (*Danio rerio*). The zebrafish is a highly unique model organism that afford many unique opportunities to interrogate the microbiome.

I wanted to continue my research on the gut microbiome with zebrafish, so I continued my Ph.D. research with the Sharpton lab.


What do you do now?
-------------------

I'm currently in my third year as a Ph.D. student in the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ at Oregon State University. My research combines molecular, computational and statistical approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the gut microbiome that influence our health. In other words, I'm interested in figuring out how the microbes that coexist with us, specifically in our guts, influence our health.


What is this site for?
----------------------

The goal of this site is to provide a central location to share my research, projects and blog.
