Hi there! My name is Michael Sieler. I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the Sharpton Lab at Oregon State University. My research combines molecular, computational and statistical approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the gut microbiome that influence our health. In other words, I'm interested in figuring out how the microbes that coexist with us, specifically in our guts, influence our health.
