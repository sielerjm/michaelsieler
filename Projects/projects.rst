In collaboration with `Dr. Stephen Atkinson <https://microbiology.oregonstate.edu/dr-stephen-atkinson>`_ (lab website) in the department of Microbiology at Oregon State University, I have been actively developing an educational game called `Virtual Fish <https://github.com/OSU-Edu-Games/Virtual-Fish>`_ (GitHub).

Virtual Fish is a tamagotchi-like game where players take care of a fish by feeding it, cleaning its tank, and administering it medicine whenever it gets an infection.

Tools used:

- C#, Unity (software development)
- GitHub (version control, game hosting)

As part of a Data Visualization course taught by Dr. Charlotte Wickham (yes, that Wickham), we were tasked with making an interactive visualization based on a large dataset we found from database.

`For my project <https://michael-sieler.shinyapps.io/Spotify_heatmap/>`_ (RShiny app), I chose a dataset derived from Spotify curated on Kaggle. The dataset contained data on a quarter million songs with over two dozen features per song. The data for these songs needed to be filtered and wrangled. After reducing the data set to a tenth its original size, I transformed and normalized the data to make an interactive heat map.

Tools used:

- Kaggle (data source)
- R (data wrangling, visualization)
