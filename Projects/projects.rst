In collaboration with `Dr. Stephen Atkinson <https://microbiology.oregonstate.edu/dr-stephen-atkinson>`_ in the department of Microbiology at Oregon State University, I have been actively developing an educational game called `Virtual Fish <https://github.com/OSU-Edu-Games/Virtual-Fish>`_

Virtual Fish is a tamagotchi-like game where players take care of a fish by feeding it, cleaning its tank, and administering it medicine whenever it gets an infection.

Tools used:
- C#, Unity

As part of a Data Visualization course taught by Dr. Charlotte Wickham (yes, that Wickham), we were tasked with making an interactive visualization based on some data we gathered from a database online.

`For my project <https://michael-sieler.shinyapps.io/Spotify_heatmap/>`_, I chose a dataset from Spotify curated on Kaggle. The dataset originally had around a quarter million rows, that needed to be filtered and wrangled. After reducing the data set to a tenth its original size, I performed some transformation and normalization of the data to have it play nicely as a heatmap.

Tools used:
- Kaggle (data source), R (data wrangling, visualization)
