In collaboration with `Dr. Stephen Atkinson <https://microbiology.oregonstate.edu/dr-stephen-atkinson>`_ in the department of Microbiology at Oregon State University, I have been actively developing an educational game called `Virtual Fish <https://github.com/OSU-Edu-Games/Virtual-Fish>`_

Virtual Fish is a tamagotchi-like game where players take care of a fish by feeding it, cleaning its tank, and administering it medicine whenever it gets an infection.

Tools used:
- C#, Unity

As part of a Data Visualization course taught by Dr. Charlotte Wickham (yes, that Wickham), we were tasked with making an interactive visualization based on a large dataset we found from database.

`For my project <https://michael-sieler.shinyapps.io/Spotify_heatmap/>`_, I chose a dataset derived Spotify curated on Kaggle. The dataset contained quarter million rows (songs) with over two dozen features per row. The data for these songs needed to be filtered and wrangled. After reducing the data set to a tenth its original size, I performed some transformation and normalization of the data to have it play nicely as a heatmap.

Tools used:
- Kaggle (data source), R (data wrangling, visualization)
