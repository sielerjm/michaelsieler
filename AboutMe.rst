Who are you?
------------

I'm Michael Sieler, a Microbiology Ph.D. student minoring in Biological Data Science in the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ at Oregon State University (OSU).


What is your background?
------------------------

Briefly, I got my bachelor's degree in Bioresource Research with a focus in Bioinformatics and Genomics at Oregon State University.

Throughout my undergrad I conducted research alongside Ph.D. students and post-docs as well as independently. These experiences catalyzed my interest in studying the gut microbiome, and led me to join the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ for graduate school.


What do you do now?
-------------------

I'm in my fourth year of my Ph.D program. My research focuses on how environmental factors (diet, pollutants, pathogens, etc.) impact gut microbiome stability and resilience to influence host health using the zebrafish model organism.


What is this site for?
----------------------

The goal of this site is to provide a central location to share my `research and work experience <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Experience/experience.html>`_, `projects <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Projects/projects.html>`_ and `blog <https://blog.michaelsieler.com/>`_.
