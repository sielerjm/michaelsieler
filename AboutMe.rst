Who are you?
------------

My name is Michael Sieler. I’m a 5th year PhD candidate in the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ in the Microbiology Department at Oregon State University (OSU). 


What is your background?
------------------------

Briefly, I got my bachelor's degree in Bioresource Research with a focus in Bioinformatics and Genomics at Oregon State University.

Throughout my undergrad I conducted research alongside Ph.D. students and post-docs as well as independently. These experiences catalyzed my interest in studying the gut microbiome, and led me to join the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ for graduate school.


What do you do now?
-------------------

I’m a 5th year PhD candidate in the `Sharpton Lab <http://lab.sharpton.org>`_ at Oregon State University (OSU). I research how environmental factors (diet, pollutants, pathogens, climate change, etc.) impact gut microbiome stability and resilience to influence host health using the zebrafish model organism. To do this, I use an ecological lens and combine molecular and computational biological methods to better understand how environmental factors (e.g. diet, climate change, parasites) interact with the gut microbiome to influence host health and homeostasis. 


What do you want to do next?
----------------------------

In my next role, I'm interested in opportunities where I can further develop my computational multi-omic analytical skills and contribute to projects interrogating how the gut microbiome influences host health. 


What is this site for?
----------------------

The goal of this site is to provide a central location to share my `research and work experience <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Experience/experience.html>`_.


How can I contact you?
----------------------

The best way to reach me is by `reach out <mailto:sielerjm@oregonstate.edu>`_ .
