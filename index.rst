My name is Michael Sieler. I'm a microbiome data scientist. I recently earned my PhD in the Sharpton Lab in the Department of Microbiology at Oregon State University. Currently, I'm continuing my research in the Sharpton Lab for the remainder of the year as a research associate. In 2026, I will be joining the `<https://genev.unige.ch/research/laboratory/joanito-liberti>`_ at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, to begin my postdoctoral fellowship investigating the social microbiome of bees.

The purpose of this site is to provide a central space to share my `research <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Publications/publications.html>`_ and `work <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Experience/experience.html>`_ experience, and `projects <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Projects/projects.html>`_. 

Have a look around and don't hesitate to `reach out <mailto:sielerjm@oregonstate.edu>`_ to me if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
