My name is Michael Sieler. I'm a microbiome data scientist. I'm in my final year as a PhD Candidate in the Sharpton Lab in the department of Microbiology at Oregon State University. I'm looking for bioinformatics-based `postdoctoral positions <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Career/postdoc.html>`_ starting in Fall 2025.

The purpose of this site is to provide a central space to share my `research <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Publications/publications.html>`_ and `work <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Experience/experience.html>`_ experience, and `projects <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Projects/projects.html>`_. 

Have a look around and don't hesitate to `reach out <mailto:sielerjm@oregonstate.edu>`_ to me if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
