Welcome! My name is Michael Sieler. I'm a 3rd year PhD Student in the department of Microbiology at Oregon State University. The goal of this site is to provide a central space to share my `research and work experience <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Experience/experience.html>`_, `projects <https://michaelsieler.com/en/latest/Projects/projects.html>`_ and `blog <https://blog.michaelsieler.com/>`_. Have a look around and don't hesitate to `reach out <sielerjm@oregonstate.edu>`_ to me if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
